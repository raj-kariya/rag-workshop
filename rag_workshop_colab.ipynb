This little bag can make at least c hundred of these bottles, if not much more. What a great saving! I make a bottle (or two) of chia water, add agave syrup and stevia to it and slowly drink throughout the day. These seeds have so many benefits! And I LOVE the smooth sensation of them on my tongue. It's a fun water, and I am buying more. For now I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and my bag is still almost fool.\n",

For the money, I would buy this again over the regular Five Hour Power product.\n",
            "Doc 3 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Yum!; Content: This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....\n",

I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.<br /><br />I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.<br />I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.<br /><br />The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water.\n",

I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad.\n",

For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany.

With more folks (like myself) these days seeking out sugarless soft drinks, this Switch product is actually quite good, I thought. Easy and small enough to carry. Might want to bring two.

            "Doc 14 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Good idea, but they leak; Content: Disposakups....great idea, because K-kups are expensive and aren't necessarily available in your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Disposakups fit well into the Keurig coffee maker, the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea.  However, the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid.<br /><br />I tried several of these disposakups. After the first few leaked I thought maybe I was not snapping the lid on tight enough, so I made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on REALLY tight, no gaps! They still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup, which then drips outside the k-kup holder chamber...and outside the catch area.  I needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use.<br /><br />I give this item 3 stars because they do work, and are a great idea, but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking.  If you don't mind a bit of cleanup after each use....you'll appreciate these.<br /><br />I'll use the rest of the box, and continue cleaning up after each use, but I won't buy more.<br /><br />The seller offered a refund, but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as I would receive as a refund.\n",
            "Doc 15 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Very High in Iron; Content: I bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family physician.  He said my mom has iron deficiency anemia.  As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.<br /><br />One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.  If you like the taste of black licorice, I'd say you'll probably like the taste of this.\n",

Surprisingly soda-like for being a juice product.; Content: Note:  I tried the watermelon-kiwi flavor first, and this review provides comparison to that flavor as well as unique information.<br /><br />Design/packaging:  I really like the can size.  It's narrower than a soda can, but the same height as a soda can.  It fits very nicely in my hand, and I could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack.<br /><br />Nutrition:  The calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink, but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure, unsweetened grape juice, it's the same calorie and sugar count, plus or minus 10%.  (It's worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient, so this makes sense.)  Thus, they're probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink.  The thing is, you probably shouldn't down ten of these a day, but one can as a snack or pick-me-up seems reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor:  Here's where Switch fell short in the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious.  It was not overly sweet like Watermelon-Kiwi.  I'm also very impressed with the flavor.  It's like a less-sweet orange soda, except that it's with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners.  I think this would be a great mixer as well as a nice snack beverage.\n",

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"\n",

The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)\n",

Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties.

I do not even associate with proletarians, and can only imagine the horrors that these \"people\" committ against decent food.  Can't these people just eat sensibly, or not at all.

            "Doc 103 score: 0.0000 -> Title: A Wish for Guilt Free Flavor; Content: The first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. \"100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.\"<br /><br />2. \"Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.\"<br /><br />3. The logo has \"THE\" placed upside-down and reversed, atop \"Switch,\" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)\"<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI\">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts<br /><br />P.S.<br />With chagrin and apologies I've had to add comment updates here\n",

You're at the store and thinking, man, I really need to get me some new yeast. This sounded intriguing. An Alt strain, clean and rapid fermentation. Tolerant of cold conditions. In short, it is a hard working and industrious yeast that does its job without much fanfare. And it cleans up after itself. Only the Germans would have such a yeast. It's not like the California yeasts that are kind of fruity, or the British yeasts that just leave a mess. It's very German.<br /><br />You could easily pass this off as a lager yeast. I did a very simple wheat / pale malt light ale. 1.032 OG. 1.008 FG. Fermented at about 60-62 give or take. Grain to bottle in a week. I wasn't too concerned with flocculation or haze but that's just me. Cracked on the other day just to get a taste. Extremely clean. You can taste every single grain of the malt. I didn't hop it much. Maybe 15 IBU tops with magnum. Very nice lawnmower or pounding beer.<br /><br />Blow off tube is mandatory. Next project is a 1.062 American wheat. Blew out the airlock. I had 5 gallons in a 6 gallon carboy and it wanted enough space for 10 gallons. Very vigorous.<br /><br />If you want an absolutely crisp, clean yeast that produces very lager like beers and can tolerate temps down to about 55, this is it. Seems to really accentuate malt. Very nice yeast, but I like a little yeast profile so I don't know if I'm in love with it. Just impressed at how clean it is.\n",

Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those \"single shot\" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.\n",

Audio output sinewaves show up very clean and accurate under an oscilloscope, with peaks at 90 degrees (which is a good sign).  No hissing sounds at all, it's very quiet with a mic connected, high frequency-spectrum wise.  For the record, I bought a usb to Toslink output adapter to connect to the amplifier because integrated laptop/PC sound cards are usually noisy as hell.<br /><br />I think some people are using mics with very low sensitivity or crappy output sources (e.g. cheesy soundcards, amps, receivers or multimedia speakers), or even lousy, improperly shielded mic cables and blaming the unit, but who knows.  What I can safely say is, for the cheap price, the unit manages to produce an output that has a very high gain and runs virtually flat while covering the entire audio spectrum.<br /><br />WINDOW7 FUNCTIONALITY(updated):<br />At first, it didn't work with WINDOWS7 x64 Ultimate.  I kept getting a message about not being able to find a driver.  And at the time the Icicle website made no mention of Windows 7 compatibility (2 months later, they are saying it's compatible with XP, VISTA and Windows 7).  After nearly giving up, I found my old USB motorola cell phone charger cable lying around and noticed it had a similar mini-usb header to the that of the Icicle's.  I connected the Icicle using the motorola cable into my Windows 7 PC, and to my surprise it was recognized.  I actually got the idea when the Icicle began losing its USB connection (with the original cable) whenever I moved it around a lot.  Could it be the dinky looking USB cable included with the Icile causing intermittent disconnects or driver problems with Windows 7?  I'm really not sure at this point.  What I can say is that the Blue Icicle seems 100% reliable when used with the old Motorola USB cable.  Perhaps the Motorola cable makes better contact or has better shielding--who knows.  (I'm inclined to cut away the white insulation of the original Icicle cable just see if it's shielded to the USB's electrical ground source.  It wouldn't be the first time I find an unshielded USB cable.  Then again, it might be the mini-USB header causing the problem.)\n",

I also love to eat healthy, and for me that means avoiding corn syrup whenever possible. I was sent these gummy bears by accident when I ordered the sour gummy bears (also by Surf Sweets) and I am glad I was, as these are absolutely delicious. They have the same texture as regular gummy bears, though if you let them warm up a little bit or get an off batch they may be a little bit chewier.  Some find them a little bit sweeter than regular gummy bears, but I think that is due to the lack of corn syrup. I don't really notice any difference. Note that these do still contain gelatin, so vegans should NOT eat this (I think that their jelly beans and the gummy worms are safe for vegans). The natural fruit juice flavors are delicious, and the fact that you get your vitamin C as well is just an added bonus. I would definitely recommend these, though I suggest you get these small bags over the large ones as otherwise you might find yourself eating the whole thing in one go!<br /><br />One last caveat - if you are on a budget I suggest you go with the Surf Sweets Sour Gummy Bears (also available on Amazon) as they are ten dollars cheaper.

First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound.

I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, \"Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?\" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife.

I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food.  I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right?  So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged.  How could this be BBQ?  They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything.  I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed.  (I know...\"I thought you said 5 stars.\"  It gets better.)<br /><br />Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps.  I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again.  What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps.  I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder.  I polished the next bags off in three days.<br /><br />Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon ($1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food).  My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful.  Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips.  You'll feel better about snacking!\n",

The difference it made in salads and vegetables, sauces and meats was unbelievable.  There is a pleasingly clean, peppery bite that makes it distinctive, adding a bold delicious flavor to fresh salads, cooked vegetables and roasted chicken and meats.  I've tried many other brands of extra virgin, pure, select or other types of olive oils growing up in an Italian household and in my 66 years, none of them stimulated the taste buds with the savory satisfaction delivered by Academia Barilla Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The product is not widely known but the laboratories at Academia Barilla in Italy have developed as good a commercial product as is currently on the market and in my opinion, it is the very best.  The cost is high but consistent with the higher end oils.  But, if you enjoy fine foods and preparing aromatic dishes, simply put,  this oil turns them into a gift.

I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays \"NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS\" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays \"CAFFENE FREE\".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.\n",

My wife has bought about every single brand of instant decaf coffee for me along with assorted \"real\" decaf to try in her drip coffee maker. Hated em all, just hated them.

From that next batch on, I became hooked on this brand. I don't like the price, but love the taste.  That conflict alone makes me drop my rating to give it a 4 star overall.

It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.<br /><br />The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink.

I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.<br /><br />The tangerine is the dominant flavor. However it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or, perhaps, a clementine. There is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor. I could see people not liking it while other do.<br /><br />Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else. These aren't nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isn't necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda.

AMAZON, why can't you stock the Hawaiian Hazelnut the same way you stock the other flavors??

The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste.

Basically, it's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate, or as they say: \"100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola [cherry] juice concentrates).\"<br /><br />Gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages: \"high fructose corn syrup\" or the old standby \"sugar\"...<br /><br />Basically, it reminds me of a carbonated version of Tropicana Pure or one of the Odwalla beverages, watered down just slightly (not quite as sugary, but still pretty darned sweet).<br /><br />Overall, I rather liked it. It's a bit smaller than your typical Pepsi or Coca-cola can. But I could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such. Slightly better than typical \"soda\" with corn syrup. Though I'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice...<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have the fruit juice (like a Hansen's smoothie or something, granted they're a bit sugarier)... But some folks like carbonated beverages. So, why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff?<br /><br />Rather liked the Orange Tangerine one.

Plus more importantly the price so far is still excellent; all the others are ridiculous on pricing I have noticed, increasing by $4 or $5 in some cases.  I was getting Maxwell House Hazelnut, but this coffee is much tastier; and Maxwell House has gotten way too pricey for the quality of their hazelnut after experiencing Community's bolder flavored hazelnut.  You can actually taste Hazelnut in Community Coffee.  It's a bit bolder, but I like a good cup of coffee where you can actually taste the coffee (yeah).  I do not buy or search for Maxwell House any longer, nor do I enjoy Folgers or any of the much more expensive brands as none of them compare to the rich flavor of Community Hazelnut Coffee.  I just hope that now, finally after finding a decent tasting coffee at a good price, Amazon keeps it in stock for awhile.\n",

There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.\n",

            "Doc 500 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Family Favorite; Content: I can't imagine why but it seems that grocery stores have stopped stocking this item. If you haven't tried it you must, it is the best coating mix available and my family keeps asking me to make chicken only with this shake and bake. It has a very different flavor than any BBQ sauce on the market, a flavor all it's own that is really delicious and goes with any side dish. I have made stuffing, mashed potatoes (a favorite) and almost any vegetable to go with it and everyone always has a second helping of chicken.It's perfect for company because it is unique and tastes like something you would cook for a special occasion. I am always afraid that they will stop making it, it really has become a staple in our home and even the most finicky people love it, kids all seem to love it and I love it because it is quick and easy. It's a very unique flavor, I want to say a little sweeter than most BBQ sauces or flavorings but not really sweet , kind of like a honey BBQ but better, that can be used on pork chops as well. There is a plastic bag enclosed to shake it in but I find that more of the mix sticks to the sides and it is very hard to coat the chicken , a lot of wasted mix that way. I put it on a plate a little at a time and add as needed, then I rinse the chicken pieces and kind of lightly roll them on the plate in the coating (shaking a little out of the packet on spots that are not coated) and then place them into a baking pan that I line with foil, it makes clean up much easier after cooking, almost don't need to wash the pan this way.Try to get all the pieces covered especially on the tops because the bottom will come off a little bit from the grease that cooks out of the chicken. Any mix left in the packet I shake on pieces that don't look completely covered and then just on top of all of them. I usually get a package of about 3 or 4 half breasts and a package of 6 thighs and one pack of mix will cover it all if you roll it on a plate. It becomes very sticky when it gets wet so it will stick to the plate, your fingers and of course the chicken pieces. I have also used a little bit of plum jam brushed on the chicken before coating it and thats very good too, but honestly you don't need to add anything it is delicious the way it is. Cook it long enough to get browned and crispy and remove it to a serving dish right away so it doesn't sit in the grease and you will be extremely happy with the results. I would really be interested to hear from someone who has never cooked with this before and see what they think.\n",

I have worked as a gluten free lifestyle coach for GF diagnosed people for years helping them to adjust to the diet and Pamela's flour is one of the first things I steer them to.  It is a great all-around gluten free flour.  It is not too light, like rice flour and not too heavy like a bean flour.  It does substitute well in all of my recipes.  It's baking outcome is very desireable.  I have never had trouble with it. In fact, many times the comments I get on my baked goods from my non-GF friends is that they can't tell it's gluten free.<br /><br />Now, to  be fair, I need to mention that it does have dairy and nuts in it.

The regular coffees were very good better than many. I really liked the Amazonia and the Africana medium roasts, not so much the Colombian. The dark roast Eclipse, Mexican, and French Roast were very good. I made them into ice coffee, strong but not bitter. I didn't care for the Costa Rican light roast, it had an artificial taste to me. The House blend was good but nothing to write home about. I hate decaf so I used that K-cup to water my plants with, so as far as taste goes I have no idea but my plants perked up.

Smooth, Not Bitter, Plenty Strong But Not Too Strong.; Content: NOTE: This one is better for me at the smallest cup setting, which makes it stronger.<br /><br />This is my first time to try Wolfgang Puck coffee. I have mixed feelings about it so far. The Rodeo Drive Blend is a little more 'bland' than I'm used to, which is great for people who prefer that. It's just a different taste, which is good or not-so-good, depending on each person's preference. Personally, ever so often I take a sip of Rodeo Drive Blend and think that it almost tasted like dishwater. Then that goes away and I enjoy the rest of the cup of coffee. I think that reaction is because it isn't as strong and bold as I'm used to, but it's pretty good. I can see that some people might make this their favorite because it is different.<br /><br />Will I buy this again? No. It's good, but it's not my preference, and I might as well buy the ones that make me rave on and on about how good they are, usually Tully's French, Kona, Italian, and House. Those may be too strong for some people, and the Rodeo Drive Blend does have its own unique taste which may really appeal to some coffee drinkers. As with most things, actually a little more than in most things, with coffee, it's a matter of taste and probably a matter of what you are in the habit of drinking. You may want to try this one, especially if you can find it in a sample packet, or do like I do, keep the rest for guests to try.\n",

The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)<br /><br />I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.<br /><br />For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!<br /><br />NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter.\n",

I like Izze, but do not like Switch much.<br /><br />Switch tastes -- and is -- just like orange juice, except it is carbonated.  I do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated.  It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.

The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean.

But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.

I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route.\n",

            "Doc 668 score: 0.0000 -> Title: It's all in the numbers...; Content: The advert for Switch describes it as a \"healthy alternative to soda\" and \"a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation.\" To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda-lovers. In my mind this doesn't quite balance the scale<br /><br />As to the second claim: I liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink. It reminded me of Orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it, but it might strike some as too sugary-sweet. All in all I think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all, no in-betweens. However, it can be considered \"healty\" only in small doses (one can day, say) and should be avoided by low-carb dieters.\n",

I have tried 20+ K-cup varieties and this is by far my favorite.  Contrary to some reviews, I don't find it to be weak at all and in fact, is quite bold but with absolutely not hints of being bitter.  Very smooth and leaves a great aftertaste.  I prefer really strong coffee and this is a good compromise for a medium roast as it's not as bold as I would normally prefer but certainly strong enough to satisfy my preferences.<br /><br />I typically drink Wolfgang's Jamaica Me Crazy but ever since trying Rodeo Drive, I haven't gone back.\n",

This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time.

I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured \"food\" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.\n",

(and this is important because one does tend to follow recipes to a fault) you must use half as much as the recipe calls for, which btw, does not work as well as you'd hope.  It's just not nearly as sweet cup for cup.<br /><br />I make that up using extra Splenda white because I use brown sugar for it's sweetness as well as the molasses flavor.  This is why I will only give it four stars....because they COULD make it cup for cup by doing what I do and adding more Splenda white so a baker could follow their recipe and not give it a second thought.  Heaven knows they're charging enough for it.<br /><br />I'm sure you know this:  Brown sugar is unrefined or molasses sugar.  You can make your own brown sugar by adding 1 tablespoon unsulfured molasses to 1 cup cane sugar and mixing it with a fork. It comes out nice and fluffy and you can control how much caramel flavor it has.  (and how much extra sugar too)<br /><br />Splenda brown sugar blend as it is, is a very coarsely granulated Splenda, a little coarser than Splenda white.  So the texture is better than what you might mix up on your own.  So for convenience, you can't beat Splenda brown sugar blend.  The Splenda brand is superior (in my opinion) to the store brands that are popping up but YMMV, and your store might have a really good version.<br /><br />Still...and this accounts for a very good four stars you can always count on Splenda, for texture, for flavor and consistency.

The idea is, one takes a plastic cup, puts in the pre-molded filter, adds one's own coffee grounds, closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the brewer, disposing of it at the end.  However...the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy, such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid, the entire cup collapses, accordion style...another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering, so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups...these two problems defeating the purpose of \"fast\" which is basically the primary advantage of Keurig brewers in the first place.  Another advantage of the brewer is the lack of a mess, which these cups also do not address well....there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following brewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder...granted it is not major clean-up, but nevertheless...  And finally, the potential advantage of cost savings...the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive, but add in the cost of shipping and handling, which is some $6 on top of the featured price (about 50% more), and the per cup price increases...try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost...no go, the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package; ergo, if you were to say order 100 cups, you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling.  In addition to the other problems with the design, it more or less defeats the purpose.  Large packages of the pre-made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per-pod cost.  Would not recommend these, until the company lowers shipping costs, improves design, or both.  You're better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer, and simply rinsing it out...same time involved, less cost and lower environmental impact.\n",

This Bisquick mix is by far the best I have found for making scones (plain or sweet) and biscuits!  The Orange biscuits, cheddar biscuits and raisin scones I have made were delicious. It was easy to substitute this mix into my old recipes, because unlike some gluten free mixes, I found I can play around with this and don't have to measure everything absolutely precisely to get a good outcome.  Of course, you can't roll this dough out like traditional dough, it has to be dropped onto the baking sheet in spoonfuls.  I have found that if I don't make it too sticky, I can gently form the balls in my hands to give a more regular shape to my scones and biscuits. I have also used it for making deep dish chicken pie and pizza (be sure you press it nice and thin in the pan - I use a silicone spatula to press it so that it doesn't stick). Bisquick Mix is made by the Betty Crocker company and this, along with the Betty Crocker cakes and brownie mixes, allows me to indulge in delicious baked goods again!

I'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. I'll admit up front that I haven't had a key lime pie for years, so I don't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)<br /><br />This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but it's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, it's 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn't want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn't last nearly long enough.<br /><br />I'll absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes.\n",

About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list.\n",

It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink.  I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this \"natural\" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  However, unlike the watermelon flavor, I found this variety vibrant and delicious.  The fruit flavor really comes through, including the often tricky tangerine.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.\n",

Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas.\n",

            "Doc 852 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more; Content: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.\n",

            "Doc 858 score: 0.0000 -> Title: A Muddy Orange Flavor; Content: While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely \"natural\" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.\n",

We were lucky because I just happened to check that one. Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times. I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it. I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer. Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />We also recently opened 5 other jars in this flat after my son refused to eat them and realized that they were rotten.  3 of them were completely solid and domed at the top!  We poked a toothpick down to the bottom of the jar and it was dry throughout.  Shortly after eating his last dinner of this box, my son started vomiting and refused to eat.  We have contacted the USDA about this.  If this happens to you, please same your jars so you can give them the information they need.

No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.<br /><br />I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!<br /><br />I love using my <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0\">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0T2\">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)</a>and filter cone (similar to this one:<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S\">Ready Set Joe/Mug</a>) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.<br /><br />Take time to \"bloom the grounds\" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).<br /><br />Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.<br /><br />Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!\n",

Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren't considered good for you, so it's odd that the two would be mixed.<br /><br />Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer's) there's a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it's not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.<br /><br />You're also gettinbg \"Natural flavours and colours\" which kind of kills the whole \"100% juice\" claim.<br /><br />With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can't really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation.\n",

I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being \"tangy\" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star.

And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.

As we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said, don't forget to check that her treats are high quality/natural too.  As we were already purchasing the Wellness brand from her list, we tried these treats.<br /><br />On first glance I thought, wow, almost $5.00 for this little bag, that's pricey, but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time.  My cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky-not sure if these treats contribute, but they could.  We love the fact that they don't have corn, wheat, soy or a bunch of other stuff she really doesn't need.  We also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat....it worked!  People laugh, but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down.  If you don't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again....smart kitty and she loves those treats.  This is the first flavor we tried, but have since tried others and she loves them all.<br /><br />If you would like to try something more natural for your kitty, I would give these a go.

It is a South American blend for those who prefer a brighter more acidic kind of brew, but is still well balanced and make s a fine cup of Java.<br /><br />The coffee comes in an attractive,  black bag with a bag with the now ubiquitous air valve.  The folks at Melitta know how to compact coffee for travel--all ambient air was sucked out of the bag, shrinking the usual size of the 10 ounces from its expected size, to a small, dense brick.  Cutting open the bag, there was an audible hiss as the bag seemed to expand to double its size.  The aroma was intoxicating--think deep coffee with chocolate hints and with nothing acrid about it.  The bag does not indicate the level of the roast, but on inspection the coffee appears to be a darker roast (somewhere between a `full city' and European).  The bag states that this is an extra fine grind, but on inspection it seems to be less powdery than you'd want for fine espresso, and is more of a fine grind.  This, I imagine, is meant a compromise so that the coffee is suitable for both the common drip coffee machines that use a filter or could be used with an espresso machine.<br /><br />For some reason, the instructions indicate that you should use two level teaspoons for every six ounces of water.  I'm not sure how they drink coffee in Europe, but in the US coffee machines measure by the cup.  This leads to a bizarre ~2.7 teaspoons of coffee per cup and (to my taste) a slightly weak cup of coffee.  In spite of the grind, I'd stick with the usual 1 tablespoon per cup proportion for your drip coffee maker and work up from there.  Your intuition should serve you well, and I'd stick with your usual measurements (I'm one of those `heaping' tablespoon per cup guys).<br /><br />The coffee definitely shows its South American origins.  In spite of the darkness of the roast and richness of the aroma, the coffee once  brewed is more light, breakfasty, and slightly more acidic than I imagined it would be. Given the type of coffee that it is, it also might have benefited from a slightly lighter roast. Still, it is a well balanced South American blend.  It lacks the distinctiveness of a single origin coffee but given that it is a blend has a more rounded, less biting flavor.  Although decaffeinating can sometimes sap the bold flavors of a coffee, this coffee still has a lot of personality and a distinctive taste.<br /><br />This is not for the pure coffee lover who likes a dark, earthy, and oily cup of java that can basically stand on its own.  This coffee is more for people who like to add a lot of buffer--a fair amount of milk and sugar or one of those Torani syrups (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2QS\">Torani Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>) for a little extra flavor, for those who like those kind of things.  It also makes a great iced coffee.  If cold brewed, the coffee loses its tannic edge and is more smooth and sweet, but also loses a little personality in the process. (I did not try using this in an espresso machine as I do not have one, but I don't think that it would yield a great espresso.  Concentrated, I think the acidity might become overwhelming.)<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine blend of coffee at a fine price.  With a little experimentation on the proportions, it yields a fine cup of breakfast coffee.\n",

It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use \"natural flavors\" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called \"effervescent decaffeination\" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, \"Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness.\" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday.

Could be either a zip-lock bag or a twist tie closure... doesn't make any difference... just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bugs out of it.<br /><br />This is a health and spoilage issue... 50#'s of oatmeal is a lot of product and needs to either be repackaged by the consumer in small food grade bags or containers (very expensive and hard to find}.

            "Doc 1001 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Good brand of food; Content: I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)\n",

But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent.

Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.  Trouble is, the filters size and shape indicate they should hang over the outside edge of the cup, but when doing that I found it impossible to seal the cups.  So I had to tuck the filter inside to be able to close and seal the lid.  After doing that and trying, the coffee ran VERY slow though the K-Cup and after only about three cups, the Keurig machine seemed to get clogged up and stop working.  I cleaned out with vinegar and tried again, but same result.  I ended up throwing these away as it didn't seem worth the effort to return them.  NOT a good product!\n",

The drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus.  This is definitely a lighter tasting, very refreshing drink.

I could really taste the orange-flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour/bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasn't bad, but given a choice, I'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I don't see how this drink improves beyond that.

That means this will last for months, if not years--although it's also easy to use too much. 1 tablespoon of the flakes = 1/2 tsp of the powder.  The ratio most cooks call for is 1 cup liquid to 1 teaspoon flaked agar agar, which means 1/4 tsp of this powder to 1 cup liquid, with more added for more acidic things like orange juice.<br /><br />However, agar agar doesn't gel as well as Jell-o, so don't expect to get the same results that you would for Jell-o--for that, you need Jell-o or kosher gelatin.

The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.

I guess it depends on what you are deciding to \"switch\" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.

I'm newly diagnosed celiac and thus new to GF, so perhaps I should let a little more time go by on just a diet of naturally gluten free foods before I start trying substitute foods for the wheat foods I used to love, but I swear I cried a little bit when I ate these pancakes.  Because I thought they sucked, frankly.  They are completely bland and have no flavor at ALL, and the texture was reminiscent of wallpaper paste. (I don't know if that's gluten free but if so it's probably cheaper to just put some syrup on that and eat it!) After letting the batter stand 10 minutes to thicken up a bit, it was more like kindergarten paste, but still totally flavorless.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up, so that's something.

Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \"100 calorie packs\" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\" & \"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.\n",

However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!\n",

The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only.

But enough people have said good things about these seeds that I decided to jump on the chia seed bandwagon and order up a bag.<br /><br />***Health Benefits***<br />- extremely high concentration of omega-3 acids (more than salmon)<br />- complete protein!  What does that mean?  I had to look it up too. :)  It means chia seeds contain all the essential amino acids your body needs.  So you could just eat nothing but chia seeds and survive.  Most veggies don't have that, meaning you need to mix and match various plant sources to get everything all the things your body can't synthesize on its own. 1 serving (10g / 1 tbsp) = 2g protein -- higher than most other grains and seeds.  Other plant sources with complete protein = quinoa, soybean, buckwheat & hempseed<br />- good source of fibre & potassium & calcium<br />- 3x the iron than spinach<br />- low in cholesterol & sodium<br />- doesn't have drawbacks like flaxseed does with being a laxative and doesn't have estrogen-like effects<br /><br />***Uses & Taste***<br />Chia seeds taste pretty good!  Rather, there's no strong taste the way sesame does, so you just have more of a crunchy texture if you eat them dry, or a thicker jelly-like texture if you soak them in water for a little bit.<br /><br />Ideas for use: In a salad, added to smoothies, in a breakfast granola or yogurt, in oatmeal, used as an egg replacement in baked goods, on sushi, to make iskiate (chia fresca) -- a Tarahumara energy drink, or just straight up have a spoonful.  I recently made pancakes and threw in a few tablespoons and it worked out great.<br /><br />One thing to note is these seeds can stick in your teeth, so be sure to do a quick mirror check after eating them. :)<br /><br />***This brand***<br />I haven't bought any other brand of chia seeds, but this one works so why switch?  Seeds tasted fresh when I opened the package and stayed fresh during the 2 months it took me to go through my bag.  Bag is resealable, price on Amazon was better than in stores = a good buy.<br /><br />Overall I'm feeling pretty good about eating chia seeds instead of cupcakes although that has me thinking...next kitchen experiment - lemon chia cupcakes!

I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.<br /><br />A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste \"coconutty\" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more.\n",

I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.

Once received I opened it up and gave a good sniff.  I know to some that may sound stupid, but I love to open coffee and have the aroma surround me, this coffee did not do that as much as others that I have used.  I had to really give a good sniff to smell the aroma, but it smelled pretty good once I got my nose in there.<br /><br />I set out to brew myself a pot.  I followed the directions and enlisted my husband to have a cup with me.  Now usually I do not drink decaffeinated, so I was just a little concerned. Decaf to me can taste very flat. But I waited and a nice smell filled the air.  Finally our coffee was ready and we both sat down to taste this product. My husband smiled. He loves any coffee that has Arabica beans. He looked at me and said, \"ummm this is really good.\"  My turn.  I sniffed some more, I'm a real sniffer before anything goes into my body.  It still smelled pretty good so now for the taste test.<br /><br />Okay, it was definitely different than the Dunkin  Donuts coffee that I'm use to and love. However,it had a smooth flavor, but  a little richer than I like and I didn't seem to notice that it was decaf, that was a good thing.  It was flavorful and made a pretty good cup of coffee.

It is 100% juice concentrate which has been reconstituted with carbonated water, so it is much healthier for them than regular soda.

Surprisingly, I was pretty impressed with the flavor which to me tastes almost as good as regular Bisquick.<br /><br />I followed a reviewer's suggestion to let the batter sit for about 15 minutes after adding just the milk; the batter looked better and was a nicer consistency after the resting time. It was a little hard to get all the lumps out of the batter though and because I have limited GF experience I wasn't sure whether further stirring would gum it up so I left some lumps in and they dissolved while cooking.<br /><br />The texture of the cooked pancakes was very SLIGHTLY gritty. Makes pancakes a little thinner than with regular Bisquick however thick enough that I'd say they are just right. See photo added.<br /><br />I used a cast iron griddle to make the pancakes, which made them barely crisp outside and nice tender inside - *very* good!!!<br /><br />The taste is close to regular Bisquick but a little more \"plain\" - I use real maple syrup and sometimes preserves and with either of the two toppings, I had a very good, very tasty short stack.<br /><br />My only quibble is that this mix is a little pricey but I'd rather buy this mix than other GF products I've tried that are just as pricey and don't taste nearly as good.\n",

But I was looking for something that we could eat in the morning that was not meat/dairy/egg, and was gluten-free, and filling, without being pure sugar like most breakfast foods and especially grains. I decided to try these long-cooking irish oats. We use 2 cups water and 1/2 cup dry oats, for 1/4cup dry each. It takes this stuff 30 minutes+ to cook so it is not fast food, for sure. But strangely enough, it's filling. Adding fats (couple tablespoons of cream) to the serving helps that of course. In any case, it is much tastier, and much more long-lasting for keeping us satisfied, than I expected, and surprisingly stable on blood sugar. Nor has it set off cravings like most grains, fruits, etc. do if we eat those; the sugars digest so slowly in this apparently. It is more solid and nutty than the flakey quick-oats I grew up with, which I now consider a gummy gluey sugarbomb insult to true oats.

Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue.

If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.<br /><br />However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.<br /><br />So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.

We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the \"artificial flavors\" used?  Be forewarned!\n",

First of all, making a decision on what food to buy is confusing.  They have many breed specific foods and to look at all the bags is exhausting.  With the help of a sales clerk I picked the Medium Breed adult. My dog, at first did like the food very much but I felt he was overwhelmed by the amount of food I had to feed to maintain his caloric need and gradually he lost interest in eating it.  The ingredients list was pretty standard but did have nice levels of antioxidants and omega oils.  Certainly this was not worth the price tag.\n",

K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far.

Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of \"Metabolic\" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.\n",

Needless to say, WHAT A FANTASTIC SURPRISE! The 4 boutique frozen deserts arrived packaged in dry ice and were completely frozen. My girlfriend and I were pretty enthusiastic to dive in and try them all, but took a step back to read the companies review on each of the vendors and brands. We decided that we would begin with the \"Berto's Gelato - Roasted Banana True Italian Artisan Gelato.\" After a single bite, my girlfriend declared that it might be the best gelato she has ever had, and proceeded to eat most of it while we watched TV. The best description she give as she devoured the gelato was saying it was like having \"velvet wrapping around your body.\" The additional flavors included in our shipment were Gilles Sherbet Swirl, Cedar Crest Elephant Tracks Ice Cream, and Oberweis Cookie Dough Classic. Each of the selections were very delicious and from companies I have never heard of.

The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort.

The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with \"Best By\" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost \"goof-proofed\".<br /><br />Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there!

It tastes exactly like the more expensive kind with the astronaut on the package, for a fraction of the price. After receiving this, I understand why it costs less than the \"astronaut\" kind. The packaging stinks on ice.<br /><br />Normally, freeze dried items are packaged in air tight, foil type packages, so as to not permit light, and most importantly, air into the package. Air is the enemy of freeze dried items, because it contains moisture. The product arrives it is in an air tight can, which you need to open with a can opener. Inside, the individual servings of ice cream are in paper wrappers that will NOT keep air out of the product.<br /><br />It gets worse. The paper wrappers are not only NOT air tight, but they are also ALL slit open. Every serving is slit open in several places. The can says to transfer the servings into a ziplock bag and get as much air out as possible. This may or may not keep the product fresh, but doing so is better than leaving the ice cream in the can.<br /><br />With mine, I got as much air out of the bag as I could, by closing the bag as much as possible around a straw. I then sucked the air out until I could get no more air out, then slipped the straw out, whilst closing the bag in one swift motion. You MUST do this every time you open the bag to retrieve a serving, or air will ruin the delightful texture of the ice cream. So be prepared with large ziplock bags and a straw if you order this product.\n",

So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed \"scrap\" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to \"re-label\" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the \"smaller\" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at \"perfect levels\" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) .

Just enough to make it taste more like orange soda.<br /><br />It's made with 100% juice (more apple and grape than orange, surprisingly), it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, it's all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and it's gluten free.<br /><br />The flavor of the drink I tested was called orange tangerine, and it was an 8.3 fl. oz. can, with 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I really cannot picture myself paying for it.  It's rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice I buy at the grocery store, and if I want an alternative to regular soda I would go with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIR6C\">Blue Sky Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>.

I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and \"healthier\" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better.

Since they come in packages of three, I kept one and gave two away. I couldn't open mine to clean it, so my husband had to open it and he had a hard time. I thought it was just too tight from the factory. My basil looked great after ten days. But when I went to use the basil, I could not open the pod. Husband not home...neighbor not home...dog missing thumbs. I tried lightly rapping it against the counter edge and the seam cracked right down the middle. (Okay, maybe a little harder than 'lightly,' I was pretty frustrated.) Luckily I had emptied the water, so I only had a small mess to clean up. The pod went into the garbage...forcefully. I checked with my friends. Friend #1 had the same problem and her pod is now a rooting capsule for plant clippings because she had to throw away the clear cover...it also broke when she squeezed the pod to try to open it. Friend #2 has now been warned. There were no special tips included on how to open the pod and judging from comments I've read, we're not the only ones who have had this problem. I think this was designed by the same guy that invented the  security wrapping/tape on music CDs!

Perrier is usually my first choice but sometimes I want something a little more then the fruit flavored seltzer water.  This drink fits the bill nicely.  It contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options.  It contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar, I'm okay with it.  This beverage is in a slimmer can with only 8.3 oz versus the usual 12 ozs of say, a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much.  It hits the spot when I want something sweeter then plain mineral water and it's healthier then soda.<br /><br />I've tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks.  Most of them claim to be \"all natural\" but list funky ingredients such as \"natural flavorings\"  Huh?  This beverage lists ingredients that are easily defined.  Also, it avoids the overly sweet taste of other  similar produts.  This one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect.  I guess you cannot have everything....\n",

I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me.

Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand. I'd never tried anything from this company before, but from what I had researched online, they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee. We tried their Dark Magic, Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming, to say the least. I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther.<br /><br />We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not, I figured I'd give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely. And I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee. It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent (unlike some of the other GM blends we tried). I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods. Almost. All in all, this is a very standard cup of coffee which, while it isn't anything new or exciting, is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we've been able to test out. When we run out of all the pods we've accumulated, I'll probably pick up a box of these as well.<br /><br />Now that I know Green Mountain isn't completely disappointing I'll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees (with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE\">Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> to try as well) and see how it goes from there.<br /><br />If you're looking for a go-to choice, this is your cup!\n",

Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by \"The cravings place\" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice.

            "Doc 1570 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Excellent flavor, mostly large pieces; Content: I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms. They were mostly large pieces, re-hydrated well and had good flavor. I'd estimate about 25% of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces, most likely due to the shaking about in transit. Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes. There was a small amount (perhaps an ounce or so) of very small/minced-size/dust-like pieces. Still useful to add into gravies and the like. Nothing gets wasted!<br /><br />The label says it is a product of China and Italy. Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country.<br /><br />I'm quite fond of dried mushrooms. While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones, the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus. Additionally, I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews. To save time and add flavor, I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them. Really helps meld all the flavors together. I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta. The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water.<br /><br />This was the first time I used the Roland brand (got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse), and would certainly buy them again. Highly recommend.\n",

To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It's sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to \"mixed fruit.\" It's 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you're not expecting orange you may like it.

Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!\n",

The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4\">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.\n",

            "Doc 1669 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful; Content: This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something \"strawberry\" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively \"healthy\" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.\n",

To briefly address these: There has been no evidence that Mrs. Mays keeps its workers in sweatshops; despite the Communism, I'm sure the individual citizens find these jobs valuable; and ships produce 1/10th the carbon per pound-mile of trucks, meaning a 5000 miles by ship is as bad as 500 miles by truck.<br /><br />I really like the snack and I'd give it five stars, but I'm subtracting one star: I think it is deceptive that it was so hard to find out the snack was made in China. I don't have a problem with the snack's origin, but Mrs. Mays should be more forthright with their customers and let them make the decision themselves. Granted, most of us Americans are primed to flip out at the latest Scare of the Week, but that should be our choice to make.<br /><br />Oh, and the snack itself? It is quite tasty, filling, and healthy. I will continue to purchase it.\n",

            "Doc 1685 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Our favorite breakfast choice; Content: Bought a great waffle maker two years ago.  Tried many recipes for making waffles, nothing really pleased the family. Well, until I followed a recommendation to try Stonewall Waffles.  Believe me it is not like Bisquick as I thought it might be, it is so much better I was shocked.  And well now the family loves them and looks forward to Sunday waffles every couple weeks.  I even double up the ingredients so I can make extras which we cut into smaller sections and freeze them.  These can then be used for toster waffles and a quick breakfast.  Forget the Eggos even as frozen waffles these are great.<br /><br />What do I like best about them?  The waffles come out light and fluffy.  They are crisp and hold up well to being filled with strawberries, nuts or whatever toppings you may choose.  In no way do they feel heavy or soggy.  They are a snap to prepare, and take just 3 minutes in the waffle maker. Lastly the whole family loves them.  So despite the higher price it is well worth every penny.\n",
            "Doc 1686 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Y U M M Y...........B U T......I ' V E......T A S T E D.......B E T T E R; Content: I waited quite a while before following my impuslse to buy SMOKED SALMON AND SPINACHE MOUSSE, manufactured by GOURMETFOODSTORE.  Of course, it's expensive, and I ahd to save up for it.  And it's quite caloric, as well.  However, the picture of this gourmet treat finally DID get to me, and...after returning to this picture and this product several time.....couldn't resist it any longer.  For me, it was my \"royal treat\", to celebrate the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton!<br /><br />Well, my package arrived a bit after the wedding, (today, actually) --but that's because I ordered it a bit after the wedding, (May 6, to be exact.)  I kept reminding myself how expensive this really is, and how even the Queen saves money whenever, and wherever, she can....but it was no good.  I had to at least TRY this stuff...at least once...<br /><br />The package, marked \"Perishable\", had stood out in my hallway for a few hours, as I was out this morning.  Upon opening the outer cardboard box, then the inner styrofoam box, (repleate with cold-bags, to keep the pershable food inside fresh),  I came across a small brown-cardboard box which held my Smoked Salmon Mousse.  Inside, was not one big package, as I had expected, but, instead -- to my delight -- sixt small black plastic tubs!  It seems, happily, that no matter how much you order of this Somoked Salmon Mousse, it will always be packed in these elegant little black plastic tubs.  The black contrasts nicely with the Smoked Salmon Mousse peeking through both sides of the large yellow label, that almost -- but not quite -- covers the food within.  The label says \"Terroirs d'Antan\" in big letterss, and I take it this means \"land\" of Antan, (and not \"terrors\" therefrom),<br />as \"terre\" means \"land\" in French.  Three ducks on one side and one rabbit on the other side of the central \"Terroir's d'Antan\" are \"inhabiting\" the yellow label, and we can see, in the far right distance, a huge building that looks like a French chateau -- and, indeed, right below this, in smaller letters, are the words,<br />\"The selection 'Terroirs d'Antan' revives ancient recipes from the vearious terroirs of France.  Enjoy.\"  But further down the label, it is revealed that the product was 'Made in USA - Distrib by Optimus, Inc., Miami Fl  33138.<br /><br />The larger box in which this individual serving, (actually, containing 3 servings -- 7 ounces), black plastic box came, described the contents as being \"Packed in Aspic\".  And so it is.  When the vaccum-packing, transparent plastic covering is removed, there still is another transparent layer to be removed.  My own experience with \"aspic\" had heretofore been, mainly, with learning of the title of a movie, \"A Dandy In Aspic\", starring the late, (and really great), Laurence Harvey.  I have yet to see the movie -- and have never, really, known what 'aspic' is, exceptthat it is some sort of foodstuff.  Well -- I discovered, upon taking what must be aspic off the top op of the salmon mousse, that it is similar to the temporary, plastic 'dots' that are sometimes used to keep products on cardboard backings, but are (somewhat) easily removed.  A type of transparent jello, actually -- about 1/8 inch thick.<br /><br />Well, finally I had the mousse in front of me, and it was time to eat it!<br /><br />The flavour was milder rhan I had expected -- perhaps because \"Cream Cheese\" is the first ingredient.  The smoked salmon flavour DOES come through, on occasion, and it is a nice, dark, smoked salmon flavour, indeed!  But there is far too little of this wonderfully rich smoked salmon flavour here.  (Maybe my taste buds came upon a \"pocket\" of the salmon that had not thoroughly mixed with the cream cheese.  In any event, this product should have been labled as \"Cream Cheese and Salmon Mousee\", because \"cream cheese\" is the first ingredient listed, and \"smoked salmon\" is the eighth ingredient listed, (out of 17 ingredients), and \"spinach\" is the fourteenth.  (This product was made in the USA, remember -- and if I remember correctly, ingredients here must be listed in descending order.  But -- does this<br />\"in size\" order apply to titles too?  If not, it should...<br /><br />The smoked salmon mousse has, again, a very MILD flavour.  it tastes very UNsimilar to the NY-type \"lox\" I had hoped it would.  Here, the amount of cream-cheese SO overwhelms the amount of smoked salmion, that it ALMOST tastes like exotically spiced, and flavoured, cream cheese!<br /><br />The little black \"tubs\", however, are definitely re-usable.  Of a size similar to restaurant trays for artificial sweetner, they are happily made of \"No. 5\" plastic.  According to an \"Organic Gardening\" article I read a while back, ONLY No. 5, or No. 6 plastic are safe to reuse.  So, these little black tubs can be used to hold sugar and artificial sweetener packets, stray coins, business cards, tea-bags, or any other similar object(s).  They can also be used as \"portion-control\" containers, as they hold not-too-much, and not-too-little of any food -- including, (for reference), about five rounded tablespoons of tuna spre<br />trays for<br /><br />\"Vita\" foods, (available in New York's Waldbaum's supermarkets, and probably other areas as well, sells a someked salmon and cream-cheese spread, at 8 ounces for under $3.  Ir does not have spinach, chives, eggs, tomato, or many of the other ingredients in this Smoked Salmon Mousse, sold by GourmetFoodStore. It comes in a white, round plastic tub.  As it has more smoked slamon in it, it tastes more like smoked salmon to me.  As it's kind of inconvenient for me to go to a land-based store, I certainly hope Amazon will offer this VITA product, and others, (like their herring in wine sauce), soon.  otherwise, I'll save up for, and load up on, this Vita product when next I go to Walbaum's.  The 'Smoked Salmon and Spinach Mousse Pate - All Natural,\" being reviewed here, DOES have more \"snob\" appeal, and DOES come with those nice little space-saving black tubs.  But, unlike the Vita smoked salmon and cream cheese spread, it has more smoked-salmon taste.  And that, when all is said and done, in the end, the main thing that matters in foods, doesn't it?<br /><br />P.S.  One More Plus:  The \"GourmetFoodStore\" catalogue which is included with every pruchase is an education in gourmet food, all by itself.  Did you know HOW MANY types of smoked salmon there are?  HOW many types of caviar?  Whether you buy anything (else) from \"GourmetFoodStore\", this catalogue is not only mouth-watering...but very educational!  Made on fine \"slick\" paper, and filled with beautiful cloured photos, (and also high gourmet-food prices), it is a \"gourmet\" catalogue in more ways than one!  Thanks, GourmetFoodStore!<br /><br />One More Minus:  Sadly, my food came packed in \"peanuts\".  No -- not the edible type of peanuts....the STYROFOAM type of peanuts!  It's impossible to open ANY package packed in styrofoam peanuts, without getting at least some of these innocuous-looking, but incredibly annoying little pieces of styrofoam, all over your floor! GourmetFoodStore is not the only manufacturer/ seller who does this of course....but one would think, with the wonderful, (and espensive) gourmet products they sell, that this up-market marketer would pack their food with something less annoying to the customer?  Of course, there IS the TINY advantage in having something packed in peanuts...one gets forced excercise picking up these small, but aggravating, strofoam peace-of-mind-destroyers, off the<br />floor.  OK -- a few calories are used in this way, and, if you are female, you can imagine yourself to be Ruth, (from the Bible), doing some gleaning.  However, I prefer to have MY fantasies when I desire to have them, and to excercise when _I_ decide to excercise, and NOT have these things suddenly and unexpexctedly forced upon me when opening up a package -- especially from such a luxury-goods emporium as GourmetFoodStore truly is.  Perhaps a $1 charge for having one's goods \"not to be packed in peanuts\" might be applied?  (PLEASE don't make it more than $1!)  Bubble-wrap and similar plastic space-fillers are SO appreciated by customer!  And less aggravation leads to less buying of calmatives and pain-relievers....possibly allowing for MORE money to be spent at GourmetFoodStore!  Please consider these \"suggestions for happier custumers\", dear GourmetFoodStore.  Thanks!\n",

Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more \"grainy\". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM\">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0\">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>\n",

The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.

But it is not super-wonderful-better than any other good quality soy sauce you can buy in an Asian market.  The main value is as a unique gift.<br />  In the Japanese soy sauce world, there are 4 types: regular, mild (usukuchi), for raw fish (sashimi) and light colored.  Bluegrass soy sauce is regular style.  Compared to Kikoman (a good commercial brand that is widely available) Bluegrass starts saltier, is flat in the middle, then ends with a complex & interesting flavor.  Kikoman is less salty initially and has a round, full flavor in the middle.  Doesn't have the complex ending flavors.  For me, the initial saltiness of Bluegrass is a minus and Kikoman's full middle flavor is a plus.  I prefere Kikoman, especially for dipping sushi where the flavor is more direct.  But I lived in Japan for many years and am used to the standard Japanese flavor.  I haven't tried Bluegrass blended in other food as a background flavor, which is how soy sauce is usually used.<br />  Bluegrass is a perfectly good soy sauce.  Each brand has a different flavor and everyone has their favorite.  If you want a unique Kentucky gift for an Asian friend, this is different than the standard bottle of Bourbon or box of chocolate.\n",

He has always been a dry dog food grazer who enjoyed picking out a piece or two of kibble and taking his time playing with it a while before he ate it. But he got where he couldn't chew the dry kibble, and for many reasons the canned wet dog food was not working out. This Bil-Jac Senior proved to be the answer. He is able to have the comfort of food in his bowl all day like he's used to, and he can actually eat it when he's hungry.

Plus, I'm not really awake until I smell the coffee brewing - just not morning without it.<br /><br />I tend to buy more affordable (e.g., supermarket type brands) of coffee so I can splurge on tea. So this was a real treat - outstanding aroma just opening the bag, and even better when brewing. Delightfully smooth taste, and highly drinkable black (the only way I drink coffee or tea).<br /><br />My only complaint is opening the bag. Based on what other reviewers stated, I opened it over a plastic bin so it would catch any spills. Very glad I did - an appreciable amount was spilled when I cut into the bag. I decanted it into an air-tight container. I've had this problem with other vacuum packed coffee, but the very fine grind of the Melitta made it even more of a problem.<br /><br />Still, not enough of a problem to warrant taking away a rating star. This makes a wonderful cup of coffee!\n",

Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.

The mixture will not remain as a homogeneous mixture; it will separate and must be stirred with each use.*  The goal is to raise one's systemic pH to above 7.  I've been keeping mine at 8 to 9.  Avoid use of sugar, white bread, meat and alcohol during therapy.  One may check several testimonials on the internet by searching for \"Maple Syrup Soda Bicarb therapy\".

These strips will also measure one's pH by testing saliva.

The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there.

The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not \"rifle\" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well.\n",

If you shop organic, you know how expensive this is for animal products.So far as I know, goat dairy is free from these evils.<br /><br />I tried goat products after reading a couple books on natural diet and healing by Dr Jordan Rubin. \"The Maker's Diet\" is good, but the protocols repetitive, and he is of course promoting his products he designed to recover from Crohn's. Coconut oil and goat milk were important for reasons you need to read yourself. Anyhow, it helped me, improve my health too.I find I have less congestion, allergies, and sinus problems.<br /><br />The \"goaty\" flavor can be overcome by a gradual switchover mixing some goat milk into whatever milk you use - be it cow's, soy, rice.

I tell them the Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrew does for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\"<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA\">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a>.<br /><br />The Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com.\n",

I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that.\n",

Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than \"cut\" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.

I bought the Icicle in hopes of eliminating those noise issues.<br /><br />When I received the Icicle, I couldn't wait to plug it in and take it for a \"test\" drive. Unfortunately, right off, I got an error - unable to load drivers.  This is a plug and play device, so there are no drivers to download, and I knew something wasn't right. After 3 restarts and uninstalling the USB Hubs and ports numerous times, as suggested by Icicle's troubleshooting website, it was still a no go.  I went to Icicle's website and logged a ticket, explaining the issues in detail and that I was running Windows 7.  The next day, I received an email instructing me to send the Icicle back, as it has a defective driver.  Amazon was GREAT about sending a replacement while the return was on its way.<br /><br />So, I received the replacement Icicle today, pulled it out of its packaging and with bated breath, plugged it in, hoping for success. No such luck - the same error message came up about the drivers. I decided to Google my issue:  \"Icicle compatibility with Windows 7\", and Bam!, it took me to a Guitar Center review of the Icicle that CLEARLY shows in the product specifications that it is NOT compatible with Windows 7.<br /><br />Amazon needs to get on the ball and add this to their information.  It is nowhere in Amazon's description and the Icicle \"techs\" themselves didn't have a clue about it either. I found this inadequacy with the blue mic technical team to be unacceptable.  They probably have non-technical CSRs pretending to be techs for all their troubleshooting. That's one way to save a dime, but please people - if you're going to give us \"technical support\", then say so.  If it isn't really technical support, then say it is Customer Service.<br /><br />I am terribly disappointed that this device has not been upgraded to accommodate the newer technologies.  Windows 7 has been out for some time now.  There is no indication in the little mini booklet that comes in the Icicle package that says Windows 7 is incompatible -it only gives set-up info for Mac and Windows (does not show which OS).  I am sending my Icicle back to Amazon for a refund and will need to look for something that WILL work with Windows 7.<br /><br />If you have a PC that was purchased in 2011 or later, save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this product, as your OS will more than likely be Windows 7.\n",

            "Doc 1954 score: 0.0000 -> Title: Not as good as I initially thought; Content: Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I don't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/12<br />Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...<br />My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didn't feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so I'm not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didn't have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they aren't up to snuff.\n",

In spite of that, I still give it an excellent score!<br /><br />I've always used brown sugars of all kinds in my coffee.  When at the store a few weeks ago I was looking for a lower calorie sweetener for my coffee and happened to buy this Splenda brown sugar blend.  I've been using it in my coffee since and love it.  The only difference I could tell was it was so much sweeter than my usual coffee that when I got close to the bottom of the cup I would pour more coffee into it to stretch the sweetness.  Now I know why...it's twice as sweet as regular brown sugar!<br /><br />Just ordered the 4-pack and this should tide me over for a while - adding it to teas and coffees...delicious!

The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about.

I can say that taking a glass of this juice has the same pain-killing effect as taking two Advil.  I enjoy two glasses a day - one in the morning and one at dinner.  The only down-side is the sugar, which is really the only processed sugar I eat during the day.  The juice tastes good and the quality of the syrup is consistent and pleasant.<br /><br />I usually don't go for \"miracle\" foods or diet fads, but this juice simply works - this is the real deal.
